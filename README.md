# Paddle Boards
> Open source Pong-like game

This is another one of my projects that I am using to learn about the Godot engine. 
With this I am trying to create some skills with game design and development, 
continuous integration, and unit testing. I would like to apply these skills to
other games that I end up making in the future.
